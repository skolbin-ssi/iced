Iced is a high performance and correct x86 (16/32/64-bit) instruction decoder, disassembler and assembler.

It can be used for static analysis of x86/x64 binaries, to rewrite code (eg. remove garbage instructions), to relocate code or as a disassembler.

- ✔️Supports all Intel and AMD instructions
- ✔️Correct: All instructions are tested and iced has been tested against other disassemblers/assemblers (xed, gas, objdump, masm, dumpbin, nasm, ndisasm) and fuzzed
- ✔️Supports .NET, Rust, Python, JavaScript (WebAssembly)
- ✔️The formatter supports masm, nasm, gas (AT&T), Intel (XED) and there are many options to customize the output
- ✔️The decoder is 4x+ faster than other similar libraries and doesn't allocate any memory
- ✔️Small decoded instructions, only 32 bytes
- ✔️High level Assembler (.NET) providing a simple and lean syntax (e.g `asm.mov(eax, edx)`))
- ✔️The encoder can be used to re-encode decoded instructions at any address
- ✔️API to get instruction info, eg. read/written registers, memory and rflags bits; CPUID feature flag, control flow info, etc
- ✔️License: MIT
